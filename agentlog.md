2025-12-07 17:51: Added SoundTouch runtime staging to build outputs, fixed the DSP pipeline to convert 16-bit PCM into SoundTouch's sample type (preventing heap crashes), and made KrkrSpeedController prompt for a speed so the console stays open. dsp_smoke now runs successfully with SoundTouch.dll present.
2025-12-07 19:18: Added toggleable temp-file logging (ENABLE_LOGGING), rebuilt KrkrSpeedController as a Win32 process picker with Hook + Apply injection and clamped speed input, and logged dsp_smoke scenarios; Release build succeeded and dsp_smoke still runs cleanly.
2025-12-07 19:48: Expanded speed clamp to 0.5–10x (default 1.0, recommend 0.75–2), filtered the process list to visible-window processes in the current session to avoid services/subprocesses, refreshed UI labels accordingly, and rebuilt Release successfully.
2025-12-07 20:16: Refactored the GUI into a dedicated module with tooltips, added length-gate checkbox + duration input (default 30s, validation with rollback), and wired XAudio2Hook to skip stretching buffers longer than the threshold; updated docs and verified Release build + dsp_smoke.
